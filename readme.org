* OrgPress
  These are the makefiles and scripts I use to turn org-mode manuscripts into nicely formatted HTML, PDF, Epub, and Mobi (Kindle) formats.

  *Warning*: these are presented as-is. They are undocumented, unwarrantied, and messy. 

  *Caution*: contents may contain trace amounts of AWK and M4.
